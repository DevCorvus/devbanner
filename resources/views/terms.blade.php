    <br>
    <p>DevBanner respects the intellectual property rights of others and, in appropriate circumstances, will terminate access to the "Comments" feature of the Site by users who infringe the copyrights of third parties.

You acknowledge and agree that DevBanner does not assume, and shall not have, any responsibility for the content of messages or other communications sent or received by users of the Site.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When submitting a “Comment” you will be asked to provide your name and your email address. While DevBanner does not object to your use of a pseudonym instead of your actual name, DevBanner reserves the right, but not the obligation, to reject, change, disallow, or discontinue at any time any submission name that, in DevBanner’s sole unfettered discretion, is objectionable or inappropriate for any reason. DevBanner requires the submission of your email address, but DevBanner warrants that it will not intentionally publish your email address to an outside third party, apart from DevBanner’s own affiliates, without your consent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By submitting a “Comment” to DevBanner, you agree to comply with the following rules concerning such submissions:</p>
    <br>

          <br>
          <li>Any content that personally attacks an individual whose identity can be easily learned from what you post (An example of a personal attack is posting negative comments about an individual in a way meant to demean that person. Note that posting your opinion about someone’s ideas or actions is not a personal attack).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Any content that discloses private or personal matters concerning any person.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Any content that you know to be false, misleading, or fraudulent.</li>

          <br>
          <li>Any content that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.</li>

      <li>You assert that the information, pictures, music and other files you contribute are your own, are licensed to be uploaded and downloaded by other participants, are in the public domain, or are otherwise free of copyright or other restrictions. If any part of the “Comment” is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain permission from the copyright owner before making that “Comment” available on the Web Site.</li>
      <br>
      <li>You are solely responsible for “Comment” you upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available to others using this Web Site. Under no circumstances will DevBanner be liable in any way for any “Comment” posted on or made available through this Site by you or any third party.</li>
      <br>
      <li>You understand that DevBanner does not generally pre-screen “Comments” posted on or available through the Web Site by individual authors, and that it has no obligation to do so. DevBanner and its designees have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole unfettered discretion to remove any “Comment” that is posted on or available through the Site.

    <h2 style="color: #4671a1">Security</h2>
    <p>DevBanner takes reasonably adequate security measures to detect the existence of viruses. In addition, you will see that the communication between the user and DevBanner uses a secure channel, and the transmitted data is encrypted thanks to the HTTPS protocol, therefore I guarantee the best security conditions for the confidentiality of the users.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, the user must be aware that the security measures of computer systems on the Internet are not entirely reliable and that therefore the absence of viruses or other elements that may cause alterations in computer systems (software and hardware) of the user or in their documents and files contained therein.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Even so, the owner of this website, Luis Portillo, will make every effort to keep the security, functionality and information that you will find on the website updated as far as possible. If, despite everything, you find any flaws, incorrect, outdated information, etc. I would appreciate it if you would let me know through my means of contact.</p>
