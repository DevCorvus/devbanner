<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
    The backend world is constantly evolving thanks to new technologies and innovative ways of making "business logic" work better and better year after year with the latest standards and trends. That is why it is important to keep up to date and not become obsolete in the face of the latest advances in 2022.

    Web development is by far one of the software fields with the fastest and most competitive growth in recent years, which is not the exception in 2022. In fact, it is estimated that it will continue to be so in the coming years, so keep an eye on.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    The world of backend web development has seen great technologies rise and fall over the years... <span class="italic">*Cough Cough* Ruby on Rails</span>. But also many others that have matured and lasted over time as well as other relatively recent ones that have been placed among the most popular and demanded. That's what we'll be discussing today, the best backend technologies in 2022.

        Without further hesitation let's start with Node.js and its frameworks, it can be somewhat controversial but let me explain why.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Node.js is basically server-side JavaScript, with all the wonders that it implies, that is, being the most popular language in the world and therefore the richest and fastest growing ecosystem that exists out there thanks to npm (its package manager). Year after year JavaScript is a language that has evolved and crossed the barrier of the web, extending to all kinds of tasks in software development and Node is proof of this.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="color: #4671a1">Its Backend frameworks include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text">
        <li>Express.js (most Popular and your choice as a beginner)</li>
        <li>Nest.js</li>
        <li>Meteor.js</li>
        <li>Koa.js</li>
        <li>Next.js and Gatsby (Based on React)</li>
        <li>And many others that ends with "JS".</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        If what you want is scalability and flexible control of your project, Node.js is your best choice, especially if you combine it with TypeScript.

        Python is second on this list and while it is well known for data science, machine learning, scripting, artificial intelligence, and all kinds of cool-sounding things, python web development has become one of its most prominent and in-demand functions today.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        There are a couple of frameworks that are rockstar when it comes to python web development, Django and Flask:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Django is a fairly feature-rich, elegant and simple framework that makes it the most complete of its kind. It is quite known for being used in little-known applications such as Spotify, Instagram, Youtube, Disqus, etc.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Flask on the other hand is a fairly light mini-framework that stands out in the development of RESTfull API, a very comfortable option to start with.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Just imagine bringing all the advantages of Python and its ecosystem to the web, you know... data science, machine learning, etc. If you are looking for something complex of any scale done in record time, Python with Django is a very good option.

        The Go programming language developed by Google has gained enormous strength in recent years, and is in fact the language that most people are interested in learning at the time of this article.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Go is here to stay and its demand is growing rapidly. Designed for the web and being a compiled language, Go offers a balance between high performance and simplicity considering that it is a lower level language and strong typing if we compare it to others on this list.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-gray-500">
        Note: In many cases, only the standard Go library is enough to develop complete projects, since it includes almost everything necessary for it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Go is the recommended option if you want high performance and the ease with which it can be deployed as it is a compiled language.

        Laravel is the fourth on this list and contrary to what many may think, PHP is not dead, it was just partying.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Seriously, PHP has earned a bad reputation in the past due to security issues among other things, but that's the past, nowadays it is a fairly robust and secure language, also with version 8 there have been improvements in this language that have put it at the height of others on this list.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Laravel, who puts it in this position, is the framework par excellence in the PHP ecosystem and it is that it currently holds the highest star rating on GitHub. Laravel is a fullstack web development framework, full of similar functionality in competition to Django for Python, but with its clear differences as they are based on different languages ​​with different philosophies. If it could be defined with three words, these would be its elegance, simplicity and productivity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-gray-500">
        Note: So simple that their salaries may be somewhat lower than their competitors on this list but don't let that stop you from learning it, especially if you are looking to do freelancing since Laravel and PHP in general, is the backend that dominates in this sector.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Undoubtedly an option that is still relevant and gaining prestige, if what you want is a complete and relatively easy development kit then PHP with Laravel is your best option.

        Despite the joke from earlier (My apologies Rails developers), Ruby on Rails is still one of the most used and demanded frameworks today. Written in Ruby, a programming language well known for its focus on productivity and simplicity (just like plain English).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Ruby on Rails had a golden age when it dominated the vast majority of frameworks and raised great passions, but that is now a thing of the past. Now, many new technologies have been ceded to it and its popularity has been declining. However, let's not kid ourselves, just because it's less popular than before doesn't mean it's no longer so. It is still a framework with a massive community, widely used, demanded and competent when developing fullstack projects quickly and with a very pleasant development experience. If I had to compare it to a fairly similar option in this top, it would be Laravel.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        There is no excuse not to use Ruby on Rails nowadays, the surveys are pretty clear on that. And remember... there will always be legacy code to maintain and Rails has a lot of infrastructure to work on.

        Last but not least we have the Java programming language, and there is not much to say about Java that is not already well known, without a doubt it is no longer the most important language as it used to be, but it is still the king of the corporate world in software development and is no exception on the web.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Its most popular and important framework for web development is Spring, and as might be expected coming from the Java ecosystem, it is focused on the same corporate philosophy that characterizes the environment of this programming language, although of course, there is no reason limit yourself to just that, as its apps are much more extensive like others on this list.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        As can be expected, Spring is a high-performance, secure, and reliable web development framework. Easy to test and reusable, Spring is a lightweight framework when it comes to size and transparency.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        A fairly safe, reliable, and well-performing option, especially in the corporate world and a must if you are a Java developer.

    <h3 style="color: #4671a1">Which option should I choose?</h3>
    <p>
        First, choose what you feel most comfortable with, the language that you master the most, motivates you, etc. since it's all about making it a good experience for you as a developer to work on these technologies. Do you know how to program in Python? Well, go for Django or Flask, and the same with each of the options in this list.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Second, choose what best fits the projects you want to carry out, research and find out about the technologies that interest you and do not hesitate to try them even a little, all knowledge helps but it is important to focus.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Third, try everything if you have the time. Only then can you get a much more solid vision of what the pros and cons of each technology are, based on your experience instead of constantly reading articles like this one, which despite being well documented, is still a mere point of view. So I invite you to go and experiment on your own, that's the best way to learn.
