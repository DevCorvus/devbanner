  <h1>PRIVACY & COOKIES POLICY</h1>

<main class="text-xl text-gray-200">
  <section>
    <h2 style="color: #4671a1">Our Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>As the person in charge of this website (Luis Portillo), I want to offer to you the best legal guarantees in relation to your privacy and explain to you, as clearly and transparently as possible, everything that concerns the processing of personal information within this website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This privacy policy will be valid only for personal data obtained on this website, not being applicable for information collected by third parties on other websites, even if they are linked to DevBanner.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When it comes to user privacy, DevBanner seeks to offer great transparency, confidentiality, trust and security in this regard. Let's get to the point:</p>
    <br>
    <p>The only means by which this website directly collects data from you as a user is through the comment box, which is intended to be as accessible as possible, considering that you as a user do not require "registration" to be able to give it use (Submitting your Comment).</p>
    <br>
    <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 text-gray-100">
      <p>It is important to note that your consent to the information we collect from you will be given to us at the time you use the form in the comments section, since you are not bound to do so and everything is done under your own will.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>As you can see in the form in that section, and seeking to limit the number of fields as much as possible, only three parameters are requested: <span class="text-green-200">Name</span> (Which is Optional), <span class="text-green-200">Email</span> and the actual comment (Its <span class="text-green-200">Content</span>). But... not so fast, there are two other values that we collect from you when submitting your comment: <span class="text-green-200">IP address</span>.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 text-gray-100">
      <p>The checkbox "Save this data for later?" is not included in this list as it is more related to our cookie policy detailed below, and only works to activate or not a feature without collecting any personal information from you.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>So yes, only 4 pieces of information are collected from you (One of them optional) in order to offer our features. Recapping:</p>
    <br>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Name (Optional)</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Content (Actual Comment)</li>
      <li>IP Address</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: #4671a1">But Why?</h3>
    <p>I <strong>NEVER</strong> request personal information unless it is strictly necessary to provide the services of this website. Basically nothing under the rug:</p>
    <br>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>The name is optional, but if you have one in your comment, it is a way of referring to you in case we reply to your comment and inspiring some trust between you, the authors and the general public visiting this website.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Your email because it is the only way to notify you (Through your email) if your comment has received a reply, and know if several comments come from the same email, that is, the same person (At least in theory).</li>
      <br>
      <li>The content because... without it there is no comment itself (I can't believe I had to explain that).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Your IP address for security reasons like banning certain users for inappropriate behavior and misuse of this feature.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>That is the purpose for which we collect such data and nothing more than that. This information will only be used for the benefit of the user through this website and will <strong>NEVER</strong> be shared with third parties or used for a different purpose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This information will <strong>NEVER</strong> be kept beyond what is necessary for the purposes required on this website (which we have just explained) and you can request, rectify or delete it whenever you want through our means of contact.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #4671a1">Our Cookies Policy:</h2>
    <p>Our cookie policy is an all-inclusive extension of our general privacy policy.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-gray-500 italic">What I mean by this?</h3>
    <p>Cookie policies in DevBanner are applied with the same rigor based on security and transparency for the users of this website.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 text-gray-100">
      <p>If you continue browsing, you will be giving your consent for the use of these cookies. That is why it is important that you read this cookie policy and understand that if you continue browsing, I will consider that you accept its use.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Basically only strictly necessary cookies are used, most of which are part of the functionality and security infrastructure by default of this website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Third-party cookies are used especially thanks to integrated elements that make use of them on this website. It is important to emphasize that our policies do not apply to said third-party cookies and therefore DevBanner has no responsibilities in this regard but we try that these integrated elements are from reliable sources.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Only one cookie is used for a practical purpose on this website, which is called "last-form-data" and as its name indicates it belongs to the form in the comments section, simply to save in your browser the last name and email you provided so that it does not you have to repeat it. It is completely optional by the way, you decide whether or not to store said data through the checkbox..</p>
    <br>
    <p>Of course, you can block or delete any of these cookies by means of well-known methods that you can find out there and for whatever your reasons.</p>
